              Hi all,

              <br>
              <br>
              I’m Philippe, a recently graduated Molecular Nutrition &amp; Health student based in Luxembourg. I’ve
              been following Andrei’s courses for over a year now and have been meaning to introduce myself to this
              wonderful community a while ago but never quite got round to it. But now with the recent weeks of
              confinement I thought this may be a great opportunity to get acquainted with you all.
              <br>
              <br>
              I’d also like to share with you my own experience of changing career path from what I had initially
              studied. I would be
              interested to hear your journey in changing careers and use this post as a platform to learn from each
              other and create meaningful interactions that would benefit us in the long run. Given these recent times
              of crisis I think that the need to do this has been stronger than ever before. Also, for anyone just
              starting off and in need of a motivation boost, I think sharing these stories will help in realising that
              although the road is tough, it is far from impossible to achieve.
              <br>
              <br>

              Two years ago I graduated from my study in Nutrition &amp; Health and experienced as most of you will
              probably
              know, a mixed feeling of excitement and anxiety when we are all confronted with that same question - what
              am I going to do next? For some this may be a self-evident question - you study what you love and hence
              you will pursue a career in what you have studied. But for others the question becomes a little bit more
              complicated to answer when you thought you enjoyed what you were studying, but end up at the end of the
              road realising this is not the career path you had envisioned when initially applying for it as a study. I
              experienced the latter, and though it was a difficult experience when it actually happened, the lessons
              learnt from it will be with me for a lifetime.
              <br>
              <br>
              The few weeks following my graduation were spent in stress as I was struggling to answer that very
              question I mentioned above. At that time, the idea of going into something tech-related just didn’t feel
              at all possible since I was still stuck in that mindset that if I hadn’t pursued a degree in it, my
              chances were little to none. So instead, I started applying to various job positions here and there
              related to some work experience I had gained performing various student jobs during my studies -
              management. As you can imagine, as I was just applying for it with a ‘temporary plan B’ mindset, and being
              a person that isn’t great at demonstrating false enthusiasm, it did not lead to much as this is obviously
              one of the first things interviewers are trained to notice.

              <br>
              <br>
              Following several rejections due to lack of
              experience (Luxembourg is quite a difficult job market to penetrate for anyone shifting industry, usually
              quite traditional employment process - a.k.a very high experience expectations + Bsc/Msc degree
              requirements related to the job field), I realised the only way I would increase my chances is to go back
              to what I had been taught to do so well at university - study. This is where my roadmap to web development
              began.
              <br>
              <br>
              Having no previous background in computers or tech my first feeling was more or less in line with how you
              might feel if someone asked you to uncook a roast chicken - I just had no idea how I was going to do it.
              Although I had a vague idea of where my interests were within the field, I ended up doing what I realise
              now was very inefficient and is actually one of the no-gos in Andrei’s course on more efficient learning -
              I just jumped into it without a clear roadmap of what I wanted to do and how I wanted to get there,
              something which is actually quite difficult to do when you are already feeling lost in a topic without
              even studying it.
              <br>
              <br>
              In short, I started off with a friend’s recommendation to study MarkLogic - dropped it
              after two weeks. Then I completed Pirple’s Node.js Masterclass (very interesting but definitely not for
              starters). After that, I followed their course on ES6 fundamentals, which was alright but not the best out
              there either. I then stumbled across Wes Bos’ React for beginners and Advanced React course. Fantastic
              courses, definitely recommend them but again not for beginners. Three to four months had passed, although
              I had learnt a lot of knowledge I - 1. Did not understand all of it 2. Had no idea how this was getting me
              closer to any form of job or career as a web developer.

              <br>
              <br>
              This is when I (finally) decided to think about a more concrete action plan, and when I discovered Udemy.
              At that point I had not yet discovered Andrei’s courses, so I followed a couple of others by Jonas
              Schmedtmann (very useful resources, the best being his course about Advanced CSS and Sass which is
              valuable for gaining confidence on building entire front-end pages in html/css and sass from scratch).
              Another 3-4 months had passed, and after researching what to do next, I came across Andrei’s courses. This
              was the moment I realised I had finally found that roadmap and structure I should have known about when
              starting off in this industry. Since then to this present day, I have followed 4 of his courses.
              <br>
              <br>
              I started
              off with the Complete Web Developer in 2020, followed by Complete React Developer, Learning to Learn
              Efficiently, and now currently finishing Master the Coding Interview. I don’t think that I need to further
              establish how great their overall quality is considering all the highly positive reviews, but I do want to
              add this : if you are or know anyone that is new to web development, I’d strongly recommend for them to
              start off with these courses.

              <br>
              <br>
              Although I had learnt a lot in some of the previous courses I mentioned,
              Andrei’s courses definitely add that extra essential layer of crystal clear roadmap into what is required
              to essentially get a good opportunity in this industry, along with a fantastic way to make it feel
              approachable even to the least experienced of us. Having that added structure not only gave me more
              confidence in what I was doing, but also enabled me to make all the connections with what I had learnt in
              the courses before these.

              <br>
              <br>
              Currently, I am now working since April last year as a back-end developer for a small company that
              provides consultancy on a bank software, T24. Although I was lucky enough to be hired as a junior on a no
              experience basis, and my daily job (Java development, jBASIC, batch scripting) does not have a lot to do
              with my greater interest in web development, I still consider it as an achievement in landing a very first
              job in a tech industry and a starting point to my career switch from nutrition to programming. I still
              keep on studying web development on a day to day basis after work in the hope of making it my next
              full-time job after this one as this job is more a way to keep me financially stable.
              <br>
              <br>
              You should never be afraid to make a shift from your current study or professional career for one that
              better fits who you are, and what you would like to achieve in your life. Of course I did not realise this
              at the time, and it took me around 1,5 years to start noticing this. You’re probably thinking - hold on,
              this is nothing new. But reading about it is one thing, actually experiencing it is a whole different ball
              game. Andrei’s courses played a pivotal role in pushing me towards it, and I am extremely grateful for
              this.
              <br>
              <br>

              With this, I wish you all the best during this time of crisis, and if anything take this as an
              opportunity to further improve any existing skill, or learn a new one with whichever means you have. I
              feel lucky to be part of this community and I am very keen on hearing any of your stories. Feel free to
              share it in this post, on a separate one, or in a private message.
              <br>
              <br>
              Many thanks to you all,
              <br>
              <br>
              Philippe
